# Foreword

## New terms

### 1. **Low-level Code**  
**Definition**: "Low-level" refers to programming that is close to the hardware, where you have more direct control over memory and how the computer works.  

**Example**: Writing code in C or Rust lets you manage memory yourself, unlike Python or JavaScript which handle it for you.  

**Explanation**: Imagine driving a manual car (low-level) versus an automatic (high-level). With manual, you control the gears and clutch, giving you more power and responsibility.

### 2. **Parallelism**  
**Definition**: Parallelism is when a program does many things at the same time, using multiple CPU cores.  

**Example**: If you have to download files and process images, you can do both at once instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the other.  

**Explanation**: Think of a group project where everyone works on different parts at the same time, finishing faster than if one person did everything alone.

### 3. **Ergonomic**  
**Definition**: In programming, "ergonomic" means the language or tool is designed to be easy and comfortable to use, reducing mistakes and effort.  

**Example**: Rust’s error messages are very clear and helpful, making it easier to fix bugs.  

**Explanation**: It’s like using a comfy chair and a good keyboard—they make your work easier and less tiring.

### 4. **CLI Apps**  
**Definition**: CLI stands for Command Line Interface. CLI apps are programs you run and interact with using text commands in a terminal.  

**Example**: `git`, `ls`, and `cargo` are all CLI apps you use by typing commands.  

**Explanation**: It’s like talking to your computer by typing instructions, instead of clicking buttons in a window.

### 5. **Web Server**  
**Definition**: A web server is a program that listens for requests from the internet and sends back web pages or data.  

**Example**: When you visit a website, your browser talks to a web server to get the page you see.  

**Explanation**: Imagine a restaurant: you (the browser) ask for food (a web page), and the server (the web server) brings it to you.

### 6. **CLI Tools vs CLI Apps**  
**Definition**: Both are programs you run in the terminal, but "CLI tools" usually do one small job (like `ls` or `grep`), while "CLI apps" can be bigger programs with more features, menus, or workflows (like `git` or `cargo`).  

**Example**: `ls` lists files (a tool), while `git` manages code repositories and has many commands and options (an app).  

**Explanation**: Think of a CLI tool as a screwdriver—simple and focused. A CLI app is like a Swiss Army knife—many tools in one, often with its own help system and subcommands.
